/*
Part 8: Continue with PrimeNumber class:
v) Overload the [] operator so that the index returns the digit
in position i, where i = 0 is the least-significant digit. If no
such digit exists then −1 should be returned. For example, if x
is of type WholeNumber and is set to 239, then x[0] should
return 9, x[1] should return 3, x[2] should return 2, and x[3]
should return −1
w) Write a part in main function which test all function and
class component implemented in this part.
